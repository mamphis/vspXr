# vspxr-extension README

This Extension is used to interact with the private extension server of vspXr.

## Usage

The extension provides a second "Extension"-View which gets the extension from a private extension registry:
[vspXr-Server](https://github.com/mamphis/vspXr/tree/master/vspXr-server)

How to install and setup the private extension registry server can be found in the repositroy of the server.

Extensions can be uploaded via the [vspXr-cli](https://github.com/mamphis/vspXr/tree/master/vspXr-cli)
